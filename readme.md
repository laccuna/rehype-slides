# slides

This is a transformer plugin for unified.js that creates HTML slides / presentations from markdown input.

## demos

Run the demos via:

```
node demo/demo.js
```

This will read the markdown files and create new HTML files in the demo folder.

## formats

At the moment the main format that is supported is reveal.js presentations. Other formats will be added in the future.
